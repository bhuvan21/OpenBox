# OpenBox  
An open source, arduino based fencing scoring box. Created with a low budget in mind (costs ~Â£50 to build), but maximal portability and functionality.

The hardware of this fencing box has been meticulously planned, designed, and put together.  
The software for the box is not yet finished, with only the at-home foil practice, as well as some settings being done.  

## Hardware  
All information on the physical build is contain in BUILD.md, within the build subdirectory.

## Software  
There are quite a few test scripts present in /tests/ which can be used for ensuring that all components connected to the microcontroller are functioning correctly.  
The main box script resides in /main/  

## Roadmap
Though still in the development stage, I think this has the potential to become a viable product. I hope to refine my design further and start deploying them in clubs, schools and tournaments.
